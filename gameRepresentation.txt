Card:
	rank [1-5]
	color [red, green, blue, white, yellow]

Deck:
	maxDeckSize [50]
	currentDeckSize [x <= 50]
	currentDeck [c1, ..., cx] ;;not known by players

Discard Pile:
	discarded [c1, c2, ...]

Played Pile:
	played [c1, c2, ...]
	validNextCards [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5] ;;one for each color

Player Hand:
	playerHandSize [x <= 5] ;; should always be 5 but could be used to draw cards
	playerHand [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5] ;;rank or color can be known or unknown
	playerNextDiscard [ci]
	playerKnownInHand [c1, ..., c5 where at least a rank or color is known]

Opponent Hand:
	opponentHand [c1,..., c5] ;;all known
	opponentNextDiscard [ci]

Game State:
	numberPlayer [2-5]
	maxClueTokens [8]
	currClueTokens [0-8]
	maxFuses [3]
	fusesLeft [0-3]
	maxHandSize [5]

Non-move actions:
	drawCard(player)
		- remove top card c from currentDeck
		- add c to player's hand

	shuffleDeck()
		-randomize cards in deck

	receiveClue([rank or color], [card indexes])
		-update playerHand
		-update playerNextDiscard
	resetGame()
	calculateScore()
		-sum the top ranks of each color in played
	gameOver()
		calculateScore()

Moves:
	discardCard(c)
		- add c to discard pile
		- drawCard(player)
	playCard(c)
		- remove c from playerHand
		- if c is in validNextCards
			- add to played
			- if c is a 5 currClueTokens++
		- if not in validNextCards:
			- fusesLeft--
			- if fusesLeft == 0 then gameOver()
			- add c to discarded
		-drawCard(player)
	giveClue(c)
		- can only be done when currClueTokens > 1
		- currClueTokens--
		- tellPlayer([rank or color], [card indexes])
		- add clue to opponentKnows

Metareasoning:
	opponentKnows [c1,..., c5] ;;what the opponent knows about their own cards
	opponentMoveGuess [move] ;;best guess at what the opponent will do
	
Reasoning:
	unknownCards [c1, ..., currentDeckSize + playerHandSize - playerKnownInHand.size()]
	pickNextMove(player) ;;the big one

;How do we decide between moves?
;	- need some sort of ranking system for how "good" a move is


;Things we can value (but in what order??):
;	- Opponent having a good move
;	- Playing a good move
;	- Minimizing possiblity of losing important cards (especially with  1 copy left)
;	- *Discarding bad cards for more clues *(this is up for debate)

;"Good Touch Principle" https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Beginners.md
;	- Do we only give "good" clues of cards that will be played?
;	- What about lots of 1s in hand to discard?

;Other important things to represent and think about:
;	- Recency? If they give me a clue and multiple cards fit it to be played now, play the most ; recent one
;	-
